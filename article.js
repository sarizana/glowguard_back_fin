Lightweight, oil-free moisturizers with hyaluronic acid keep skin hydrated without greasiness. Avoid alcohol-based products, as they strip natural oils and trigger more oil production. Blotting papers can help manage shine throughout the day. Clay masks 1-2 times a week absorb excess oil. Always finish with sunscreen (gel-based for oily skin). Consistency is key—stick to a routine for 4-6 weeks to see results.\n\nPro Tip: Double cleansing (oil cleanser + water-based cleanser) removes excess sebum without irritation.",

      "content": "Razor burn occurs when the skin is irritated by shaving. To prevent it, always use a sharp razor and shave in the direction of hair growth. After shaving, rinse with cold water to close pores. Apply an alcohol-free aftershave with witch hazel or aloe vera to calm the skin. Follow up with a lightweight moisturizer containing ceramides to restore the skin barrier. For extra protection, use a product with tea tree oil to prevent bacterial infections. Avoid touching your face immediately after shaving to reduce irritation.\n\nPro Tip: Replace your razor blade every 5-7 shaves to ensure a clean cut.",

For styling, choose a balm with natural ingredients like shea butter. Don’t forget to moisturize the skin underneath—beard dandruff is often caused by dry skin.

To treat them, apply a warm compress to soften the skin, then gently exfoliate with a salicylic acid (BHA) cleanser. Use tweezers to lift trapped hairs—never dig into the skin. Prevent future ingrown hairs by shaving with a single-blade razor and using a pre-shave oil. Moisturize with glycolic acid lotions to keep skin exfoliated. For severe cases, try laser hair reduction.\n\nWarning: Picking at ingrown hairs can lead to scars or infections.",
